What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You are telling git to keep track of the files inside the directory, allowing the further commands and commits to happen.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

in the working directory are containd all the files, in the repository you find the history of one or several files
and the stagging area is where the files that are going to be commited must be placed. it offers the option of not 
fullfilling the repository with every file, but whit the ones that may be altered in the future of the proyect.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

git status should be clean after a logical change is made, if i think i havent, status will show 
me in the stagging area what ive missed

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

now with commits i have the history of different changes in a proyect, now with branches i can 
change more deep structure therefore experimenting with other solutions or technics and not overfiling a single text code
